Project 1:
Creates a system to manage a database saved on the hard drive by creating cluster files in which every block stores a number of database entries. It supports updating the block files with new entries and retrieving existing entries inside the file.

Project 2:
Creates a system to store database entries on the hard drive that are organized into B+ trees for optimal entry retrieval time. It creates an index file which points to the appropriate data block depending on the entry ID.
